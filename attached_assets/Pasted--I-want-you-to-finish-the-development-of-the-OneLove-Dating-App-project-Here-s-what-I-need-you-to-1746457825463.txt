✅ I want you to finish the development of the OneLove Dating App project.

Here's what I need you to complete now:

🔮 1. AI Profile System (Preloaded)
Create 1000+ preloaded AI profiles with:

name, country, gender, age, photo URL, personality tag

scripted responses for flirting, romantic chat, jokes, emotional support

Each AI profile should have a unique character and chat script based on personality type

Integrate these into a fake chat system with real users (but no calls)

Create AIProfile.kt, AIProfileRepository, and AIChatViewModel

Add an AIChatScreen for chatting with AI profiles

🔐 2. Cloud Functions for Payments
Create Firebase Cloud Functions to:

Handle Stripe webhooks for payment confirmation

Update Firestore with verified subscriptions

Send custom FCM notifications on successful payment

Integrate with SubscriptionViewModel and PremiumAccessManager

💬 3. Finish Notifications System
Finalize NotificationsActivity.kt

Connect push notifications with FCM

Show updates for messages, matches, offers, subscription reminders

📈 4. Boost Profile & Point System
Add point system:

Earn points for daily login, uploading media, watching videos

Spend points for boost or sending premium offers

Show current points in profile sidebar

Build PointsManager, BoostManager, and RewardViewModel

👨‍🔧 5. Final Bug Fixes & Cleanup
Ensure all ViewModels, Repositories, UI Screens, and Navigation routes are complete

Finalize all UI states: loading, error, empty, success

Ensure all features respect access control (free vs premium)

Final QA: Fix any missing links or unresolved classes

📦 6. Prepare for Production
Ensure full Firebase integration

Use latest AGP, Kotlin, Firebase BOM, Compose versions

Optimize build.gradle, dependencies, and permission declarations

Generate a release variant ready for publishing on Play Store
