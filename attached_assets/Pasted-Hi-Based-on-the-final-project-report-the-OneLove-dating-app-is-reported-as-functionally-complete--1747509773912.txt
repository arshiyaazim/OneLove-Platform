Hi! Based on the final project report, the OneLove dating app is reported as functionally complete. However, I noticed the following discrepancies and would like to address them to ensure the project is fully production-ready and nothing is missed:

‚úÖ 1. Ensure All Files Are Updated and Downloadable
Please verify that every app file has been updated and saved, including README.md, configuration files, code scripts, resources, assets, and Gradle build files.

Ensure the project is fully packaged and downloadable as a .zip with all necessary directories and files.

üîç 2. Clarify and Access Version Conflict Tools
The report mentions tools/scripts for managing version conflicts like:

Gradle dependencies

Theme resources

Color definitions

Please confirm:

Where are these tools/scripts located in the project?

Do these tools need to be executed manually via a terminal command, or do they run automatically during build time or on changes?

Provide documentation or command examples if they require manual execution.

üö´ 3. Missing Files During GitHub Upload
When uploading to GitHub, several files (such as executables or essential scripts) were not detected or uploaded.

Please identify:

Which files were excluded?

Why did GitHub not find or include them?

Ensure the full, working app structure is pushed to GitHub, including all necessary backend/frontend components and executable scripts.

üìÅ 4. Update Project to Match README.txt
Based on README.txt, please:

Update all code files, project structure, and dependencies accordingly.

Make sure each feature (auth, AI matchmaking, chat, video calls, Stripe integration, admin panel) is correctly reflected and linked in the updated README.md.

Include any additional support files, folders, libraries, or configuration files referenced in the readme.

‚úÖ 5. Final Check: Prepare for GitHub & Android Studio
Run a final verification that the entire project is:

Clean of missing references or resource links

Consistent with the README instructions

Fully functional and structured to be:

Uploaded to GitHub with all essential files

Downloadable as a .zip and directly importable into Android Studio for testing and deployment
