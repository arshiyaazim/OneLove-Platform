Hi, I’ve completed an initial review and attempted to test the OneLove dating app in Android Studio. However, I'm encountering several critical issues that need your support to resolve. Below is a categorized summary of the problems and questions:

🛠️ 1. Android Studio SDK Build Errors (XML parsing + sync issues)
I’m seeing this error during Gradle sync:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
This version only understands SDK XML versions up to 3 but an SDK XML file of version 4 was encountered.
package.xml parsing problem. unexpected element (uri:"", local:"abis")
✅ Please ensure that:

The SDK command-line tools used in the project are compatible with Android Studio Hedgehog or later.

No deprecated or corrupt SDK metadata is being referenced.

The correct compileSdkVersion, buildToolsVersion, and tools are in place to avoid this issue.

📦 2. Dependency Resolution Error – Compose Testing Library
I'm getting:

css
Copy
Edit
Failed to resolve: androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-junit4
However, the following dependencies are declared in the project:

androidx.test.ext:junit:1.1.5

junit:junit:4.13.2

✅ Please:

Confirm if ui-test-junit4 is declared in the proper scope.

Ensure the google() and mavenCentral() repositories are correctly listed in both build.gradle.kts (project) and settings.gradle.kts.

Update or correct any missing dependency versions related to Compose UI testing.

📄 3. AndroidManifest.xml Errors and Warnings
Warnings include:

Camera permission exists without a matching <uses-feature android:required="false"/> declaration.

Deprecated permission WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE used (not effective in Android 10+).

Missing support for Selected Photos Access on Android 14+.

✅ Please:

Add <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>

Remove deprecated storage permissions and replace with:

xml
Copy
Edit
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" android:maxSdkVersion="32" />
Implement logic or permission handling for scoped photo access in Android 14+.

🧠 4. MainActivity.kt – Overload Resolution Ambiguity
Error shown:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
Overload resolution ambiguity:
- public constructor OneLoveApp()
- public fun OneLoveApp(): Unit
✅ This occurs because the app defines both a class and a function named OneLoveApp() in the same package/scope.
Please remove or rename the function to avoid conflicting with the class OneLoveApp : Application().

⚙️ 5. build.gradle.kts (app) – Outdated Targets and Upgrade Concerns
Warnings include:

Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply.

compileSdkVersion 35 is available (currently using 34).

❗My app is currently based on older Android SDKs, and upgrading may break compatibility or introduce new dependency issues.

✅ Please:

Review whether it’s safe to upgrade to compileSdkVersion 35 and targetSdkVersion 35 without breaking current features.

If an upgrade is applied, ensure all dependencies and libraries are compatible and the Manifest and permissions reflect modern API requirements.
