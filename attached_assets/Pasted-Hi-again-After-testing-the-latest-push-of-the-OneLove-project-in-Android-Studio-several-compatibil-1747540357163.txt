Hi again! After testing the latest push of the OneLove project in Android Studio, several compatibility issues and a UI refinement checkpoint remain. Please resolve the following to ensure full build stability and a polished user experience:

‚úÖ 1. SDK & Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) Compatibility
I‚Äôve downgraded the project to compileSdk = 34 to avoid issues with AGP 8.2.0 (which officially supports up to SDK 34).

However, the current project still contains warnings or config referencing SDK 35. Please:

Ensure all modules use compileSdk and targetSdk = 34

Remove or adjust android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=35 if no longer needed

Align all build files to this SDK version

‚úÖ 2. Kotlin Version Conflict with Dependencies
I am using Kotlin 1.9.20, but many Firebase/Google libraries (like Firebase Auth, Analytics KTX, Play Services) were compiled with Kotlin 2.1.0, causing metadata version errors.

Please:

Downgrade those dependencies to versions compiled with Kotlin 1.9.x

Or update the project to use Kotlin 2.1.0 safely ‚Äî but only if all other modules and dependencies support it

‚ö†Ô∏è Mixing Kotlin 1.9.x and 2.1.0 leads to build failure. Please choose a consistent approach.

‚úÖ 3. Fix AndroidManifest.xml and Permissions for Modern Android
Remove deprecated permissions like WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

Add scoped storage permissions for Android 10+ and photo picker support for Android 14+

Ensure these are added correctly:

xml
Copy
Edit
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>
Confirm any missing flags or logic related to Android 13/14+ permission handling are addressed

‚úÖ 4. Clean Kotlin Function/Class Naming Conflicts
You fixed the OneLoveApp() naming ambiguity ‚Äî thanks!

Please make sure no duplicate or misleading names remain that might resurface during refactoring.

üé® 5. [Checkpoint] Update App UI and Theme Presentation
Please modernize and polish the app‚Äôs UI, following Material Design 3 principles:

Define a clean Compose theme setup (Theme.kt)

Light/dark mode support

Primary/secondary color schemes

Typography scale using MaterialTheme.typography

Apply consistent theming across all screens (auth, chat, video, subscriptions)

If not already done, use Material 3 components:

Button, TextField, Scaffold, TopAppBar, etc.

Ensure UI is adaptive for Android 10 to 14+ devices
