Hi again, based on my analysis and your previous report, I’ve fixed the Firebase Performance plugin issue and improved tooling. I now need your help ensuring the following final steps are completed and validated before upload:

🔄 1. Verify All Files Are Updated and Present
Double-check that all edited and newly created files, including:

README.md (updated based on README.txt)

google-services.json placeholder

All Gradle configs and build scripts

All tools/scripts in /scripts/

VERSION_CONFLICT_GUIDE.md

Any assets or resources referenced in the app

Are fully included and ready to download as a ZIP or upload to GitHub.

Specifically confirm the files previously missing from GitHub upload are now present and properly linked.

📄 2. README.md Should Be Complete and Accurate
Replace the outdated or blank README.md with a complete version based on:

Final features: Auth, AI matchmaking, chat, video/audio calls, Stripe billing, admin panel

Setup instructions: Firebase setup, script usage, build instructions

Any usage notes for the helper scripts or special dependencies

⚙️ 3. Version Conflict Tools Ready and Documented
Confirm that all scripts in /scripts/ directory work as expected:

version_conflict_helper.sh

Any additional Gradle or theme resource management scripts

Verify that docs/VERSION_CONFLICT_GUIDE.md clearly explains:

Where each script is

How and when to use it

Whether they run automatically or require manual execution

Example commands to run them

🔥 4. Firebase Setup
Ensure the app contains a placeholder google-services.json in app/

Clearly note that this file must be updated before actual deployment

Confirm all Firebase-related dependencies are present in build.gradle files but won’t break the build if the JSON is missing or incomplete

🧪 5. Build Test and Final GitHub Upload
Test a clean build locally to confirm:

Firebase Performance plugin (commented out) doesn’t cause build failures

All dependencies are correctly resolved

Scripts execute as expected

Include:

All source code

All helper scripts

Complete documentation

Any assets or layouts

Add a .gitignore that:

Excludes google-services.json and other sensitive items

Still ensures all build-critical files/scripts are included

❓Final Check
Please confirm if all of the above is done. If yes:

I’ll proceed to upload the finalized project to GitHub

Download the ZIP and test in Android Studio with my Firebase config
