You’ve built a solid foundation. Now let’s wrap this app into a production-ready and upgrade-safe package.

Please proceed with the next feature: ✅ subscription management with Stripe — and in parallel, apply the following upgrade readiness and stability steps:

### 🔐 Final Feature Completion & Stability Requirements:

1. ✅ Finish any remaining screens:
   - Subscription flow (Free, Premium, Gold plans)
   - Admin panel
   - Profile filtering and search
   - Notification center for matches, messages, and updates
   - AI profile interaction screen

2. ✅ Resolve or prevent:
   - Duplicate themes, colors, or function logic
   - Dependency errors, version mismatches, or symbol resolution failures
   - Unused imports, code bloat, or outdated layouts

3. ✅ Confirm usage of:
   - AGP 8.2.0
   - Kotlin 1.9.20
   - Gradle 8.2
   - Java 17
   - `targetSdk = 34`, `minSdk = 24`

4. ✅ Make the project upgrade-resilient:
   - Use version catalogs or comment plugin versions in `build.gradle.kts`
   - Include a clear `upgrade_guide.md` file explaining how to upgrade AGP, Kotlin, Compose, libraries
   - Keep project modular with separate folders/packages for features (chat, profile, discover, etc.)

5. ✅ Enable easy feature scaling:
   - Allow add/remove/edit of colors via `colors.xml` without conflict
   - Maintain clearly scoped themes (e.g., `Theme.OneLove.Main`)
   - Ensure that any duplicated style or color gracefully falls back or logs the issue

6. ✅ Runtime compatibility & future-proofing:
   - Add version checks using `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` where needed
   - Suppress SDK upgrade prompts in gradle when possible
   - Validate app runs cleanly on Android 14+ devices

7. ✅ Ensure clean build & testing:
   - Gradle sync passes without warnings
   - Lint shows no blocking errors
   - App builds into APK/AAB without needing AGP or plugin upgrades
   - Test flows: login → discover → match → chat → call → profile → subscription

8. ✅ Export final deliverables:
   - Fully functional and clean Android Studio ZIP
   - Optional: a signed debug APK for demo testing
